One evening, her mother gave her a special nightlight that glowed softly, assuring her that it would keep the monsters away. That night, as she drifted off to sleep, she felt safe for the first time. However, when she woke up in the middle of the night, she noticed the light flickering. As she turned to check her closet, she saw a shadowy figure emerging. Heart racing, she realized it was her own reflection in the mirror, illuminated by the nightlight. She laughed at her fear, thinking it was just her imagination. But as she turned back to her bed, she heard a whisper, \"You should have stayed under the covers.\""

Gathering his courage, he tiptoed down the creaky stairs, clutching a flashlight. As he rummaged through the boxes, he heard a noise behind him and froze. He turned to see a pair of glowing eyes staring back at him. Terrified, he screamed and ran back upstairs, convinced he had seen a ghost. The next day, his parents revealed that they had been playing a prank on him, using a glow-in-the-dark sticker on an old toy. They all laughed, but Tommy couldn't shake the feeling that something was still down there, watching him."
